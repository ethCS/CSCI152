## What I Learned in CSCI152

This course gave me **hands-on experience in Java** while building projects that reinforced key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts** and algorithmic thinking.

**Key Java & OOP Concepts:**

- **Encapsulation:** Learned to protect internal data by making fields private and exposing clean, controlled interfaces through public methods.  
- **Inheritance:** Built classes that can extend other classes, promoting code reuse and logical hierarchy.  
- **Polymorphism:** Implemented methods that behave differently depending on object type, allowing flexible and scalable designs.  
- **Abstraction:** Designed classes and methods to hide complex implementation details and expose only the necessary interfaces.  
- **Composition:** Assembled complex objects from smaller components (e.g., Rubik’s Cube faces as arrays inside a cube object).  
- **Recursion:** Used recursive algorithms for problem-solving, such as depth-first search (DFS) for Go board territory calculation.  
- **Exception Handling:** Built robust programs that gracefully handle invalid input using `try-catch` blocks.  
- **Data Structures:** Applied arrays, 2D arrays, Sets, and HashMaps to model game boards and cube states effectively.  
- **Modular Design:** Organized code into classes and methods for clarity, reusability, and maintainability.  
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Developed logic for game rules, cube rotations, scoring, and state management.

**Practical Skills Gained:**

- Writing clean, maintainable, and reusable Java code  
- Structuring projects for easy compilation and execution  
- Working with CLI input, parsing arguments, and interactive terminal output  
- Debugging complex problems in a systematic, logical way
