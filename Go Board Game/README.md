  <em>Example of a 9x9 Go board in action</em>
</p>


A sophisticated Java implementation of Go written during my CSCI152 class, engineered for two players on a 9x9 board. This project is more than just a game—it’s a showcase of algorithmic design and software craftsmanship:

Smart Game Logic: Fully implements stone capturing, group life detection, and liberties using recursive depth-first search.

Automated Scoring Engine: Dynamically calculates territory and stone counts for precise endgame evaluation.

Resilient Player Input: Validates moves in real-time and prevents illegal actions, ensuring smooth gameplay.

Clean, Modular Architecture: Intuitive code structure emphasizes maintainability, extensibility, and algorithmic clarity.

Algorithmic Focus: Perfect for exploring recursion, graph traversal, and strategic board state management.

Whether you’re a developer studying game algorithms, a Java enthusiast, or a Go aficionado, this repo demonstrates how to bring a complex strategy game to life in the console.
